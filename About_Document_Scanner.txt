About the Project:

The code works as a Document Scanner.
It takes the url of an image as the input, finds the four corners of it,
and finally, by applying a perspective transform and thresholding on it, returns and
displays a top-down, bird’s-eye view of it with a black and white look.

Requirement: Stable Internet Connection for using the URL of the image
